# snakewatergun
A Python version of snake-water-gun, a classic Indian take on rock-paper-scissors.
Snake-water-gun has the exact same mechanics and way of playing that rock-paper-scissors does: only the names really change.
The snake beats water but loses to the gun, the gun beats the snake but loses to the water, and consequently the water beats the gun but loses to the snake.
